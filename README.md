# CTF Notes 🛡️

This repository contains my personal notes and writeups from solving beginner-to-intermediate Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. These were completed as part of my preparation for a local cybersecurity competition.

The challenges cover various categories, mostly focused on:
- Web Exploitation
- Forensics
- OSINT
- Tool usage (Wireshark, Burp Suite, etc.)

All writeups are based on my own understanding and experience solving the challenges.  
No flags or copyrighted materials are included.
