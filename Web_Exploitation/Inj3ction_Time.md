## Summary
Attempted blind SQL injection to extract data using UNION and boolean conditions.

## What I Tried
- `?id=1 UNION SELECT 1, 2, 3 --`  
  Failed: Server rejected query, likely column count/type mismatch.
  
- `1 union id=2 union id=3`  
  Syntax error, invalid SQL.

- `1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3 FROM NAME, BREED, COLOR'--`  
  Failed: Bad syntax, mixing SELECT and FROM improperly.

- Boolean-based injection:
  - `id=1 AND 1=1 --` → True condition, server responded normally.
  - `id=1 AND 1=2 --` → False condition, server response changed or no data.

## Observations
- UNION injection attempts failed because the number of columns or data types didn't match what the server expected.
- The challenge likely requires blind SQLi, extracting data one bit at a time using boolean conditions.
- Boolean injection confirmed vulnerability since server response differs on true/false.
- Need to use conditional boolean statements to extract data character by character.

## Next Steps (not done yet)
- Use payloads like:
  ```sql
  id=1 AND SUBSTRING((SELECT database()),1,1)='a'--

## Result
- No flag found yet using this approach.
- Injection is confirmed vulnerable, but data extraction needs more refined payloads or techniques.
